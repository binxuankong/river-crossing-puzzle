# River Crossing Puzzle

A prolog solution to the fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle.

A farmer wants to cross a river (from the North bank to the South bank) and take with him a fox, a goose, and a bag of beans. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer can carry only himself and one of either the fox, goose, or the bag of beans.

If the fox and the goose are alone on one bank, the fox will eat the goose. If the goose and the bag of beans are alone on the bank, the goose will eat the beans.

The farmer's challenge is to carry himself and his stocks from the North bank of the river to the South bank. How will he do it?
